# Capstone-Project

The code I rewrote for my computer engineering capstone project. This code was originally written by two other members of our team but I came in and revised it, removing an endless pit of if statements and replacing them with a cleaner and much faster array index model.

I did not originally work on the code for this project as I was responsible for it's mechanical design but as the original code was not functional, I took on the added responsibility of rewriting the arduino file.
